    <p>When ingesting videos, you can use manifest files to specify extra metadata (including the video title, description, flight times, labels, and custom metadata), as well as thumbnail and closed caption files. Manifest files are in either XML or CSV format. For details on manifests, see:</p>

    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This topic applies to OIS v2.5.</div>
    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Video Cloud does not begin processing any of the videos until the XML or CSV manifest file is received. As a result, it is important to choose a batch upload strategy. If your videos must be available quickly (e.g., news distribution), you should create very small batches or even batch them individually (one CSV or XML file per video).</div>
