  <summary>You can continue to use FTP or Aspera with a CSV manifest to ingest your videos to Video Cloud. This topic explains the structure of the CSV.</summary>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>When ingesting videos, you can use CSV manifest files to specify extra metadata (including the video title, description, flight times, labels, and custom metadata), as well as thumbnail and closed caption files. You can use CSV manifest files when you ingest content with FTP or Aspera.</p>

    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This topic applies to OIS v2.5.</div>
    <p>The CSV format of the metadata file supports fewer features than does the XML format. The CSV format allows you to specify thumbnails (preview images) and custom metadata to associate with a video. The XML format supports these features as well as the association of the names of existing defined of ad sets.</p>

    <h2 id="Handling_of_metadata">Handling of metadata</h2>
    <p>If you include <code translate="No">metadata</code> for videos when you ingest them, it is mapped to Video Cloud video fields in one of two ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>By default</strong>, each <code translate="No">metadata</code> key/value pair is added as a <em>tag</em> in the form: <code translate="No">meta::key::value</code>. For example, <code translate="No">&lt;ooyala:metadata name="category"&gt;cooking&lt;/ooyala:metadata&gt;</code> would produce the tag <code translate="No">meta::category::cooking</code></li>
      <li>If you would rather use <code translate="No">custom_fields</code> to store metadata, Brightcove Support can change a setting on your account to do that. Be aware of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>You will need to create custom fields with names corresponding to your metadata keys.</li>
          <li>The number of custom fields is limited to 10 by default, so if you will need more than that to accommodate your metadata, you will need to request additional custom fields from Support.</li>
          <li>If a custom field corresponding to each metadata item does not exist in your account, the entire metadata operation will fail.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="CSV_Manifest_Column_Headings">CSV Manifest Column Headings</h2>
    <p>The following fields are the first line (column headings) of your CSV file, with actual data fields following on subsequent rows (one row per video).</p>
    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can specify these columns in any order, and you can omit columns that you do not need, as long as the data in the data rows match the headings exactly.</div>

    <p class="p">Keep the following in mind when generating a CSV metadata file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a text value in a data field has a comma (,), you must enclose the field in double quotes (").</li>
      <li>If a text value in a data field has a double quote (") in it, you must enclose the field in double quotes and escape the double quote character in the text field with a second quote (e.g., "She said, ""Have a nice day.""" )</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p">If you are creating your CSV metadata file from Excel, it automatically handles escaping.</p>
    <p class="p">To create a CSV metadata file:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Upload one or more videos.</li>
      <li>Open a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel.</li>
      <li>Add the column headings to the first row.</li>
      <li>Add a row for each video.</li>
      <li>Save the file as a CSV. For example, you might select <strong>Save as</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu. When prompted, select the comma-separated value file type.</li>
      <li><span>With your upload method of choice, upload the CSV file as you uploaded the video(s).
