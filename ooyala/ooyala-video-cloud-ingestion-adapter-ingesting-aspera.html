<h2 id="Setting_VR_360_File_Metadata">Setting VR 360 File Metadata</h2>

<p>If you are uploading a VR 360 video file, first label the file as VR 360 and tell which type of VR 360 it is, monoscopic or stereoscopic. Use file metadata to transmit this information.</p>

<p>You can set VR 360 file metadata in the manifest file (see <a href="ingestion_fileformats.html">Manifest File Formats</a>).</p>

<p>If you are not using a manifest file, indicate the file type by setting file metadata with the <samp translate="No">ffmpeg</samp> command-line utility. For example, suppose you are going to upload a Matroska (.mkv) file. With this type of file, you can create a custom metadata tag named <samp translate="No">vr360type</samp> and assign it one of the following values: <samp translate="No">mono</samp> or <samp translate="No">stereo_lr</samp>. For example:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-bash" translate="No">ffmpeg -i inputFile.mkv -c copy -metadata "vr360type=mono" outputFile.mkv</code></pre>

<p>Some file formats do not support custom metadata. For example, with MP4 files, <samp translate="No">ffmpeg</samp> allows only predefined metadata tags. As a workaround, use the general-purpose <samp translate="No">description</samp> field with predefined values to indicate the VR 360 file type. The value of <samp translate="No">description</samp> must include the text <samp translate="No">VR 360</samp> and one of the following: <samp translate="No">mono</samp> or <samp translate="No">stereo_lr</samp>. For example:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-bash" translate="No">ffmpeg -i inputFile.mp4 -c copy -metadata "description"="VR 360 Type is mono ..."  outputFile.mp4</code></pre>

    <p>You can upload a video via the Aspera client either with or without a manifest.</p>
    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> All upload files must comply with the ingest requirements described in <a title="Before uploading content to Backlot, make sure you are using a supported file format and following the best practices for source files." href="/ooyala/ooyala-video-cloud-ingestion-supported-ingest-formats.html">Supported Ingest Formats</a></div>
    <h3>Uploading Your File(s) via the Aspera Client (OIS v2.5)</h3>
    <ol class="bcls_tasklist">
      <li>Prepare the file(s) you want to upload.</li>
      <li>In a browser, enter the endpoint transfer.ooyala.com. This endpoint will work from all locations.</li>
      <li>Log into the ingest endpoint using the credentials (email and password) of your Backlot user account.</li>
      <li>If prompted, open the Aspera app. (If no prompt appears, the Aspera app is already open.)</li>
      <li>Upload the file(s) you want to ingest (videos, thumbnails, closed caption files, and so on). If you are using a manifest file, be sure to upload all of the files that are referenced in the manifest file.</li>
      <li>Ooyala suggests that you upload the manifest file last.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Files are deleted immediately after they are all processed. Submitted files that do not go through the entire ingestion workflow (for example, awaiting the upload of the manifest file) are deleted from the server after 7 days.</p>
