    <h2 id="File_Names">File Names</h2>
    <p>During the ingestion process, the source file name will need to be passed as part of an API request URL. For that reason, the name must be URI compatible. Avoid the following in source file names for all videos and assets:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spaces</strong>: instead of <code>my video.mov</code>, use <code>my-video.mov</code> or <code>my_video.mov</code></li>
      <li><strong>Special characters</strong>: do <strong>not</strong> use the following characters in source file names: <code>"!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&amp;", "*", "(", ")", "?", "/", "\", "{", "}", "[", "]"</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Video files</h3>
    <p>Since <span class="”notranslate”">Brightcove</span> supports so many video input types, it is actually more helpful to talk about the formats we do not support. At the moment, there are only a few. The list below shows the formats <strong><em>not</em></strong> supported for Video Cloud.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>Apple Intermediate</code></li>
      <li><code>HDV 720p60</code></li>
      <li><code>Go2Meeting3 (G2M3)</code></li>
      <li><code>Avid Meridien Uncompressed</code></li>
      <li><code>Windows Media Audio Lossless</code></li>
      <li><code>CineForm</code> - partly supported; there are variants that can come from the software used to encode the source, or from OS, that make the source unusable by Video Cloud. We are still trying to identify the exact factors that cause problems.</li>
      <li><code>SWF</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Special cases</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: <code>AVdh (DNxHQ)</code> also does not work for <strong>422 10-bit and 444 12-bit sources (only)</strong> - this is a bug, and this note will be removed when it is fixed.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Content encrypted with KMS is supported but requires that you pre-sign your object URLs, ala what is outlined here: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/generating-amazon-s3-pre-signed-urls-with-sse-kms-part-2/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/generating-amazon-s3-pre-signed-urls-with-sse-kms-part-2/</a>.
        <p>Steps to implement:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a KMS managed encrypted bucket</li>
          <li>Add the Video Cloud/Zencoder Ingest Policy</li>
          <li>Create a pre-signed URL using the KMS key</li>
          <li>Use this URL when ingesting the video</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Aside from those listed above, we believe we support pretty much all known video formats. If you have problems with another video format, please <a href="https://help.brightcove.com/en/contact">Contact Brightcove Support</a> and also let <a href="mailto:docs@brightcove.com">Brightcove Learning Services</a> know.</p>
    <h3>Audio files</h3>
    <p>Most formats are supported, except when they get over 8 channels of audio. (And the audio must either be configured as a single multichannel track, or multiple mono tracks.)</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For Video Cloud ingestion, if your sources have multi-channel audio, you need to have support create custom audio renditions to correctly map the channels.</aside>
    <h3>Closed Caption files</h3>
    <p><a class="xref" title="You can ingest closed caption files via Video Cloud or the Ooyala Ingestion Service (OIS)." href="/ooyala/backlot-video-cloud-cms-connector.html">Ingesting Closed Caption Files</a>. Note that HTML5 web players like the Brightcove and Ooyala players require WebVTT captions. If you <strong>ingest</strong> DFXP or SRT captions, they will automatically be converted to WebVTT. For remote asset captions, you <strong>must</strong> use the WebVTT format.</p>
    <h3>Thumbnail and poster files</h3>
    <p class="notranslate">jpg, jpeg, png, and gif</p>

    <h2 id="Best_Practices">Best Practices</h2>
    The following recommendations will help ensure that your source files are ready to provide the best possible results.
    <p><strong class="ph b">Progressive scan, de-interlaced</strong></p>
    <p>Source video should be progressive scan (progressive, non-interlaced, de-interlaced) before uploading to Video Cloud. Although Ooyala can de-interlace the content when processing the source video, we recommend that, if you have the resources, you do this before ingesting. This allows you to confirm the quality of your video source assets at the quality control stage of your editorial workflow.</p>
    <!-- <p>The majority of consumer-level digital displays (such as LED TVs) natively support progressive video. Interlaced content, if improperly de-interlaced, can result in poor quality of display.</p> --> <!-- <p>If you have interlaced video and you would like help to de-interlace it at the time of ingestion, or if you need help identifying the quality of your video assets, please ask your Ooyala representative during your account trial period or setup.</p> --> <!-- <p><strong class="ph b">Square pixel aspect ratio</strong></p>
            <p>Source video should have a square pixel aspect ratio. The pixel should not have a non-square aspect ratio, such as anamorphic.</p>
            <p>The source video's metadata should not contain a display aspect ratio or rotational metadata. The pixels should be considered square throughout, and there should be no conflicting metadata about the transformation of the video. Conflicting metadata can decrease the quality of video output, because it is not always possible to automatically detect the issue. Typically only a human viewer would notice the type of visual distortion that can result from improper aspect ratio or rotational metadata.</p>
            <p>The majority of consumer-level digital displays natively support square pixel aspect ratio content. The use of non-square, or anamorphic, pixels was invented to support technologies like Cinemascope film projection, in which the physical width of the storage medium (film) necessitated compacting the image horizontally to fit. This restriction does not apply in modern digital video, but the use of anamorphic pixels is still present in some video assets created for early television broadcast.</p>
            <p>It is possible for the Ooyala ingestion service to force aspect ratio conversion, converting a video with non-square pixels to square pixel output streams. Ooyala support can manually enable this for you in our ingestion processes. If you need to request conversion of anamorphic to square pixels, please speak to your Ooyala representative during your account trial period or setup.</p> --></section>
